# skript-holo *(for [DecentHolograms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/decentholograms-1-8-1-21-papi-support-no-dependencies.96927/))*
This fork of skript-holo adds support for DecentHolograms and drops HolographicDisplays fully. Many syntaxes has been removed because of this. DecentHolograms API is not as extended as HolographicDisplays API at the moment. Will I ever extend support if the API gets better? Probably not. 
  
You can contact me in Discord (my username is **bilektugrul**) if you have some errors, you can ping me in skUnity. I probably will not add anything new, but I can hopefully fix errors.


Note that if a hologram follows a controlled by client entity (like player, boat, horse) the hologram will not look good to the player itself. In this case you can hide the hologram from player itself using the [Hologram Visibility](https://skripthub.net/docs/?id=3547) effect.

⚠️ Following Holograms and Hologram Visibility features require [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997).
